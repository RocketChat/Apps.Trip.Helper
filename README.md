<h1 align="center">Rocket.Chat Trip Helper</h1>

Standing in an unfamiliar place, unsure of what's going on around you, can take the fun out of exploring. The AI Travel Assistant turns that uncertainty into discovery. Just upload a photo from your trip to Rocket.Chat, and the app identifies your location, finds nearby events in real time, and delivers a clear, friendly summary. No need to search the web or guess what's nearby.
